# 3D Printable DIY Labwares

This is a repository for some DIY labwares which I have created to facilitate my experiments.

Every file comes in two formats - the original design that was drawn using DesignSpark Mechanical (.rsdoc) and the output file (.stl) which should be ready for print without any tweaks. 

## Aspirator Stand

<img src="https://github.com/tyhho/DIY_labware/blob/master/aspirator_stand/images/AS_FrontView.jpg" alt="Aspirator Stand Front View" width="300">

This aspirator stand is designed to aid researchers who have the need to pipette a layer of liquid that was fractionated by centrifugation - a process which often the demands the pipetting to be done slowly and stably so as to avoid perturbing the fractionated layers.

Please open the folder ["aspirator_stand"](https://github.com/tyhho/DIY_labware/tree/master/aspirator_stand)  for more information.

## Colony Picking Assistant

<img src="https://github.com/tyhho/DIY_labware/blob/master/diy_labware_images/ColonyPickingAssistant.jpg" alt="Colony Picking Assistant Cover" width="500">

A rack for tip rack insert to ease the process of manual colony picking. Please refer to its [wiki page](https://github.com/tyhho/DIY_labware/wiki/Colony-Picking-Assistant-(CFA)) for a full description and the recommended instructions.

Files:
* Colony Picking Assistant_200 uL tips & flat-bottom plates.stl

Recommended print setting: 20% infill, Triangle, Brim. Support (everywhere) is needed during printing.

## Universal Tube to 50 mL Tube Adaptor

<img src="https://github.com/tyhho/DIY_labware/blob/master/diy_labware_images/UniversalTubeAdaptorsForMegafuge.jpg" alt="Universal Tube to 50 mL Tube Adaptors" width="500">

An adaptor to allow 30 mL Universal Tubes to fit into megafuge slots meant for 50 mL Falcon tubes.

Files:
* Universal Tube to 50 mL Tube Adaptor.stl

Recommended print setting: 20% infill, Triangle, Brim. Invert the design and print with support (everywhere).

##  50 mL Tube Vertical-to-horizontal Roller Adaptor

<img src="https://github.com/tyhho/DIY_labware/blob/master/diy_labware_images/50mLTubeAdpatorsForHorizonalRotation.jpg" alt="50 mL Tube Adaptors For Horizontal Rotation" width="500">

An adaptor to allow 50 mL Falcon tubes to be rotated horizontally and along the axis on a STARLAB Rotator Mixer (N2400-5000 + N2400-5103 / N2400-5104). In our lab we perform primary and secondary antibody incubation of Western Blot membranes inside the 50 mL tubes. This practice allows us to cut down the volume of the diluted antibody from 25+ mL (on a rocker) to 10 mL, and to save reagents over time.

To assemble a function adaptor, print two rings per body and slide the rings from the two sides of the body tube. Ensure the rings are locked properly.

Files:
* 50 mL Tube Vertical-to-horizontal Roller Adaptor_Body.stl
* 50 mL Tube Vertical-to-horizontal Roller Adaptor_Ring.stl

Recommended print setting: 20% infill, Triangle, Brim. Support (everywhere) is needed for both files.

##  Bio-Rad DNA Gel Comb Racks

<img src="https://github.com/tyhho/DIY_labware/blob/master/diy_labware_images/RacksForGelCombs.jpg" alt="Bio-Rad DNA gel comb racks" width="500">

A rack to organize Bio-Rad DNA gel combs. This was designed to primarily allow the combs to air dry after wash. Additional benefits include creating a more organized gel running space and avoiding damaging combs when they stack on each other.

Files:
* Bio-Rad DNA Gel Comb Rack_Large_3slots.stl
* Bio-Rad DNA Gel Comb Rack_Large_7slots.stl
* Bio-Rad DNA Gel Comb Rack_Small_7slots.stl

Recommended print setting: 20% infill, Triangle, Brim.
